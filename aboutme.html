                I'm Nico Marcelino, a first year BSCS student at CIIT - College of Arts and Technology!
                <i>We are the moon</i> was built from scratch for my final output in CS101, Introduction to Computing.

                    Despite the image to the left, I'm not actually a photographer.
                    I just happen to be the one that my sister (the actual owner of the camera) goes to whenever she's in need of photoshoots.
                    Whenever I accompany her, I dress the part to feel a little more professional.
                    Truth be told, I'm more partial towards art, music, and literature.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Recently though, my passion has been for dance.
                    Granted, I haven't been dancing for too long,
                    since all my life, I was that stereotypical comsci nerd who played games,
                    studied programming, and avoided physical activities.
                    That changed when I found inspiration in professional dancers
                    and hesitantly dipped my toes into the ocean of dance.
                    It's the best decision I've made recently and I've been a lot happier for it.
                </p>

        </div>

        <p id="p3" style="font-size:1.7em">
            Still, it's making me wish I fell in love with dancing much earlier,
            because computer science is ridiculously draining. To no fault of anyone
            other than myself, I feel like my brain cells disintegrate
            every time I sit down for lectures. A lot of times, I wish I was studying
            dance instead, because that seems like a more enjoyable kind of brain-work.
            Oh well. I'll just keep working hard! Fighting! ✦
