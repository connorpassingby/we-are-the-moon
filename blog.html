                    <p>
                        During the first few months of the pandemic, I felt lost. Sure, I had more free time than I knew what to do with and I was no longer stressed by looming deadlines, but it was at the cost of routine. I lost the comfortable routine that school provides.
                        <br /><br />
                        For a while I just felt like a speck of dust floating through the galaxy, holding no purpose and holding no meaning. I didn’t know what to do with myself, and I had all this free time that ended up going to waste because of it. It’s not that I don’t have hobbies, because as far as I’m concerned, I’ve already sold my soul to good stories. But the thing is, I was suddenly thrust into a position where it was up to me to manage my own time and to decide what I wanted to do with it.
                        <br /><br />
                        Reading for hours on end, from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep – it sounds like its own pocket of paradise, but strangely enough, it made life gray out for me. I was completely in my comfort zone, and after a while, that became a bad thing.
                        <br /><br />
                        I don’t regret it and I won’t trade the experience for anything in the world. I feel like my obsession with reading was sated to the point that I somewhat calmed down about it. Before, I remember grappling for time just to sneak in a chapter or two in between the mountains of schoolwork. My enjoyment of reading was always dampened by the fact that I could only read so little. I felt a plunging disappointment every time my little reading sessions was over. It was at that point that I became so busy that I literally had no time to do anything else other than study for 90% of the time and read for the other 10%.
                        <br /><br />
                        It’s textbook burnout, so I suppose the quarantine was somewhat of a lifesaver. It was definitely an exhilarating experience to be able to just do what I wanted to do for as long as I wanted to do them. My obsession with reading calmed down a lot.
                        <br /><br />
                        With my appetite for reading out of the way, I really feel like this quarantine – this time alone to myself without having to interact with the outside world – gave me a lot of breathing room to be more introspective, to be more thoughtful. You could even say, it pushed me towards soul-searching.
                        <br /><br />
                        So that’s exactly what I did. Amidst the new normal that the pandemic pushed upon us, I discovered more about myself and who I really want to be. I think I’ve really gone through major character development. Before, I was a standoffish kind of guy in how I thought and interacted with others. I’m still standoffish now, but the main difference is that the underlying negative thoughts about it was gone and I’m left only with the natural awkwardness of a person trying to actively reach out to the world and the people around them for the first time.
                        <br /><br />
                        I found sources of euphoria that really inspired me to push beyond the boundaries and walls I set for myself – to break out of my own limiting definition of who I am and who I could be as a person. I found myself doing things I’d never considered doing before on my own volition. I found myself being more confident about the things I love doing but I’m insecure about.
                        <br /><br />
                        I’ve always loved music, and practiced singing and playing the guitar in hushed tones within the privacy of my room. I’m not the best at it, but I love it and it makes me happy, and I think that’s more than enough. The leap to dancing – something I thought I’d never do - makes sense in retrospect. I love music this much already, so why not dance to it? I fell in love with it more than I thought I would. It’s something I don’t really associate with myself, so doing it really felt like its own kind of rebirth – like a completely fresh start, with the slate cleaned of everything I defined and limited myself into being.
                        <br /><br />
                        While the pandemic had brought us multitudes of grief and tragedies, it’s not without its silver linings. I prided myself before for being “realistic”, but now I acknowledge that it was just me succumbing to my natural instinct to only see the bad in every situation. Being optimistic, I realised, is a choice I could make easily for myself and for my mental health – the easiest way to ensure I’m constantly happy instead of constantly glum. I think this shift in perspective was something I couldn’t have had if I didn’t have the opportunities and time for introspection that the lockdowns provided me. ✦
